  - composite types to service operations
- Do something with c# attributes
- Cover a few design patterns: Like the proxy pattern (This might not relate, <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client> but check it out (The proxy section that is (Svcutil.exe section)))
- Read up on how to use the Svcutil.exe tool (To create the source and config file)
- wcf service configuration editor (Look at how this tool functions as well. Under tools vs)
- Cover the 'See Also' section under: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-use-a-wcf-client>

### Random Notes

Should probably look at importing xml data (without using a client written in c# or something similar)
Something like a bulk insert, like for csv files
