# Day 1

## Objectives

- I want to improve my jQuery/ learn to use it more effectively.

## Resources

- I will be working through the w3schools jquery tutorial, found at: https://www.w3schools.com/Jquery/default.asp

### Setup

- I will have a base index file, that I can add to and change as needed, as well as a javascript file that will contain all my jquery.
- I will use a cdn to get the jQUery library.

### Suggested plan for tomorrow

- Go over the jQuery post/get ajax methods, and related things
