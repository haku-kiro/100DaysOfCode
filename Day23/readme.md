# Day 23

## Objectives

- Working with python to create a socket application (Socker server + client)

## Resources

- Using the following:
  - <https://realpython.com/python-sockets/> 

### Setup

- python files

### Suggested plan for tomorrow

- Writing xml files
  - <https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/xml/writing-xml-with-the-xmlwriter-class/>
- Do some more stuff with wcf
  - composite types to service operations
- Cover a few design patterns: Like the proxy pattern (This might not relate, <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client> but check it out (The proxy section that is (Svcutil.exe section)))
- Read up on how to use the Svcutil.exe tool (To create the source and config file)
- wcf service configuration editor (Look at how this tool functions as well. Under tools vs)
- Cover the 'See Also' section under: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-use-a-wcf-client>
- Do some work with async and await, or some threading - parallel tasks etc
- Cover how IL works, and the implications of compiler theory

### Random Notes

- There is a file called EchoServer, this contains a basic implementation of an echo server using a tcp socket (defined in python with socket.SOCK_STREAM)
- There is an insane amount of theor involved on this site... I love it, would definitely recommend <https://realpython.com/>
  - The code is explained line by line and there is more than enough information to help you understand, but not too much to make you feel like you're bored
- Going to carry on with this tomorrow... Tired...
