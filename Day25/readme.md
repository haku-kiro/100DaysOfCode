# Day 25

## Objectives

- Just did some random stuff today,
  - Started out with encoding and decoding images, to adding byte data to the image like a password, username combo
  - then tried to decode that image and look for the password, but got stuck - so needed to look for a collection of words to filter through the data.
  - When to google looing for a list of words, found a site with a table, decided to use jquery to get a list of words.

## Resources

- Google, and my brain - I guess ?

### Setup

- vs project, js file (just to hold the jquery - run in a browser on the site: <https://www.wordfrequency.info/top5000.asp> Might need to sign up or something before to get access to the list, and add jquery to the console ofc)

### Suggested plan for tomorrow

- Writing xml files
  - <https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/xml/writing-xml-with-the-xmlwriter-class/>
- Do some more stuff with wcf
  - composite types to service operations
- Cover a few design patterns: Like the proxy pattern (This might not relate, <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client> but check it out (The proxy section that is (Svcutil.exe section)))
- Read up on how to use the Svcutil.exe tool (To create the source and config file)
- wcf service configuration editor (Look at how this tool functions as well. Under tools vs)
- Cover the 'See Also' section under: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-use-a-wcf-client>
- Do some work with async and await, or some threading - parallel tasks etc
- Cover how IL works, and the implications of compiler theory
