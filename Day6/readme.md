# Day 6

## Objectives

- Working on a way to create a webserver lib with both post and get functionality (for now)
  - The goal is to use Topshelf to convert it to a server like service

## Resources

- I have used the following:
  - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistenerrequest(v=vs.110).aspx#Examples
  - https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/599978/An-HttpListener-Server-for-Handling-AJAX-POST-Requ

### Setup

- setup class c# solution and create proj + class files

### Suggested plan for tomorrow

- Continue working on the Webserver, been doing a lot of reading on the subject as well.
- The object is to create a lightweight server that can be used to run small tasks (at work as well) where I can create a pseudo api to preform business logic when calls are made to it.
