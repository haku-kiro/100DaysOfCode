# Day 8

## Objectives

- Worked on how to use promises (Kind of for work - sort of cheated)

## Resources

- I have used the following:
  -  https://promisesaplus.com/
  - And a whole bunch of google searches around chaining promises.
- Note, this relates to SAGE CRM dev, and a lot of the code has been removed (confidential stuff etc).

### Setup

- Created endpoints for the work I was busy with, to chain the api calls (using jquery and the ajax call)

### Suggested plan for tomorrow
