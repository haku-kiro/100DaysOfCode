# Day 22

## Objectives

- No internet today, but I will be working with a python module called tornado, which helps facilitate the creation of websocket servers; to enable real time communication between server and client.

## Resources

- Working through 480 Book (Websockets client) and google searches around tornado (a python module). 

### Setup

- python file for server, webpage as the client

### Suggested plan for tomorrow

- Writing xml files
  - <https://csharp.net-tutorials.com/xml/writing-xml-with-the-xmlwriter-class/>
- Do some more stuff with wcf
  - composite types to service operations
- Cover a few design patterns: Like the proxy pattern (This might not relate, <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client> but check it out (The proxy section that is (Svcutil.exe section)))
- Read up on how to use the Svcutil.exe tool (To create the source and config file)
- wcf service configuration editor (Look at how this tool functions as well. Under tools vs)
- Cover the 'See Also' section under: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/how-to-use-a-wcf-client>
- Do some work with async and await, or some threading - parallel tasks etc
- Cover how IL works, and the implications of compiler theory

### Random Notes

- This was rather difficult to do, no internet made dev slow as well as testing - upload could potentially be delayed as well.
