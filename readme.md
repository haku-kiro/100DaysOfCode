  - At least an hour.
  - Does not include work related code that you do throughout the day.
- Planning does not count towards the coding duration.
  - You should find the resources you will be working with beforehand.
  - You should make sure that any setup that is required is done beforehand.
- Must upload code to github at the end of each day.
- Code can be anthing that involves a computer and a form of system manipulation (TODO: define this better)

### Suggested help

  - You can break the pattern if you want to keep working, but you have to do at leat an hour

### Day structure

- Make sure that you do your planning first.
- Make sure that your day folder contains a readme file with your plan for that day. (Try to add to this throughout the day).
- Add day specific files to folder.
