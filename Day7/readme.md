# Day 7

## Objectives

- working on c# calls for post, and get. 
- a lot of reading on the implementation of Tasks. Some testing on the async/await asynchronous implemenation in C# 

## Resources

- I have used the following:
  - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh195051(v=vs.110).aspx#Examples
  - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/#BKMK_APIAsyncMethods

### Setup

- Building on the SimpleWebServer project

### Suggested plan for tomorrow

- Make a way to create generic methods for your simplewebserver as well as add a way to distinguish between methods (post/get) in the ctor of the webserver instead of having two different methods?
