"""
In our implementation of the scale function (page 25), the body of the loop
executes the command data[j] = factor. We have discussed that numeric
types are immutable, and that use of the = operator in this context causes
the creation of a new instance (not the mutation of an existing instance).
How is it still possible, then, that our implementation of scale changes the
actual parameter sent by the caller?

# it sets the value of the instance to the new value? 
# Meaning that the value is overwritten? #TODO: read this question properly - to tired :P
